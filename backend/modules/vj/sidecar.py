"""Manage the VJ Vite dev server as an SA3 sidecar.

The VJ project can live in an external ``GANTASMO-LIVE-VJ`` checkout
(overridable via ``theDAW_VJ_PROJECT``). If that checkout is not present,
we fall back to the small built-in VJ app at ``sidecars/vj``. It's a
vanilla Vite app — no Python, no heavy ML deps — so the spawn logic is
much simpler than the stems sidecar: just shell out to ``npm run dev``
with ``--port <N>`` and poll the port until the dev server is listening.

We deliberately use a NON-default port (5187) because:
  * 3000 (React default) is the user's explicit "don't use this"
    request — they've had too many collisions.
  * 5173 is the SA3 frontend's port.
  * 5174 is Vite's next-port fallback (so SA3 frontend often grabs it
    when 5173 is taken).
  * 5187 is far enough from those that it stays out of the way.

The port is configurable via ``theDAW_VJ_PORT``.

Lifecycle:
  * ``probe()`` — does the project exist? Does package.json look right?
    Is the port currently listening?
  * ``ensure_running()`` — lazy spawn. Returns the live URL once the
    dev server is ready, or raises RuntimeError with a diagnostic.
  * ``stop()`` — terminates the subprocess.
  * The FastAPI startup hook in router.py calls ensure_running() in
    the background so the VJ server is warm by the time the user
    clicks the VJ tab.
